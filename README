This is a simple geant4 simulation of shielding around a Ge detector. To build, perform the following steps:

cd to the directory enclosing RicochetChoozSimulation
mkdir RicochetChoozSimulation_build
cd RicochetChoozSimulation_build
cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_geant4_installation/lib(64)/Geant4-versionNum ../RicochetChoozSimulation
(on hopper this path is cmake -DGeant4_Dir=/home/soft/base/src/geant4.10.02.p01/cmake/Modules ../RicochetChoozSimulation)
make -j N RicochetChoozSimulation							 # N is number of cores
make install
