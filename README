This is a simple geant4 simulation of shielding around a Ge detector. To build, perform the following steps:

cd to the directory enclosing shieldingsim
mkdir shieldingsim_build
cd shieldingsim_build
cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_geant4_installation/lib(64)/Geant4-versionNum ../shieldingsim
make -j N shieldingsim							 # N is number of cores
make install
